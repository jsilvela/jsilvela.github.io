<p>I’ve been on a typography bender lately. This is a quick summary of my findings.</p>

<h2 id="size-matters:bad670b96275d8d3c24f67916a4f0451">Size matters</h2>

<p>Some coders have a bit of a macho attitude  about making their coding font as small as possible, on the theory that the more lines of code you fit on a screen, the better. One often sees posts from coders claiming that Monaco, DejaVu, Consolas etc. at 9–10pt is their font of choice.</p>

<p>Now that I’m approaching middle age, my eyes get tired more easily. I did a test: I printed some code onto a sheet of paper I could read comfortably. Then I compared it side by side against my monitor at regular distance. The results were shocking. For my setup (Mac Mini with a 21 inch screen), <strong>I need about 20pt font size to match regular printed letter size</strong>. No wonder my eyes were getting tired!</p>

<h2 id="fonts-for-coding-criteria:bad670b96275d8d3c24f67916a4f0451">Fonts for coding. Criteria</h2>

<ol>
<li>Not necessarily monospaced!</li>
<li>Renders well on your editor/OS.</li>
<li>Distinct capital-i, lowercase-L and number-one. Good size of punctuation. Good size of brackets, braces, parens.
This disqualifies many sans-serif fonts, which often have similar characters. Some exceptions: Verdana, Clear Type, ITC Officina.</li>
<li>Numbers are clearly distinct from letters. Notably, zero and one. Fonts with “old style figures” that don’t line up fail here. For example: Georgia, Hoefler Text.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="some-recommendations:bad670b96275d8d3c24f67916a4f0451">Some recommendations</h2>

<p><img src="http://blog.silvela.org/images/Font-comparison.png" alt="Font comparison: Verdana, Input, OCR-F, Fira Mono" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Verdana is great. The characters are distinct, there is good spacing, punctuation and brackets/braces/parens are roomy.
But I find that the long, non-spaced, camel-cased identifiers often found in code, become forbiddingly dense when set in Verdana.</li>
<li><a href="http://input.fontbureau.com/preview">Input Sans</a>. A proportional font designed for coders! It gets everything right. Except … for some reason, I find it ugly. I keep noticing it when I use it, instead of it getting out of the way. I don’t know why. But do try it!
I hope Input Sans is a sign of things to come.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/ocr-f">FF OCR-F</a>. This is a wonderful font. It’s proportional, and it keeps generous spacing between letters. More so than Verdana, and it avoids the cramped feeling for long non-spaced code. The only issue I have with it is that the font weights are extreme, either too light or too strong.</li>
<li>My current favorite monospaced font: <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/Fira/">Fira Mono</a>.</li>
</ul>
