Who invented the wheel? Some of the best ideas seem to have come after a simple What-if? moment.
Some what-if experiments are wayward, and when they work it&amp;rsquo;s just funny.
Think of Eli Cash, the not-a-genius novelist in The Royal Tenenbaums, who says about his hit novel Old Custer:</description>

They&amp;rsquo;re familiar from primary school, probably the first functions we study. But start studying abstract algebra or algebraic geometry, and they turn into two-headed beasts.
In abstract algebra you start to emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials. You define addition of two polynomials much like you define component-wise addition of vectors.</description>

This post is a summary of the classes I’ve taken in the prequel year. The 2020 / 2021 session will be &amp;ldquo;the master proper&amp;rdquo;. There’s a higher level post on my personal blog.
Galois Theory This was my greatest fear and my biggest challenge.</description>

The treatment is usually this: define $latex x \cdot y = |x| |y| \cos \theta $, where $latex \theta $ is the angle between $latex x $ and $latex y $.</description>

      <description>I was asked this question in my first job interview in the US. I was completely unprepared for this type of interview, and I did badly. But it’s a nice problem to think about and it’s easy to solve.
In case you don’t know, n factorial is the multiplication of all positive integers less than or equal to n. By convention, 0 factorial is taken as 1. The factorial is typically represented with “!</description>
