      <description>In order to prepare myself to write a program for clustering of numeric arrays, I lived for two months in a numeric array.
I got to understand the difficulties numbers face, being bunched into clusters, and how they try to maintain their individual identities and their dignity.
Above all, my JavaScript code is an homage to them. Thank you.</description>

      <description>I’m not much into superhero movies, but there is a particular plot device they use that I find fun: in the typical superhero movie, somewhere in the first half, the hero will get a chance to kill the bad guy, and he will not take it. Maybe he doesn’t yet grasp how dangerous this guy is.
And you just know there will be a second act where the bad guy will wreak havoc, and then a final act where the hero will kill the villain, or send him to jail so that there can be a sequel.</description>
