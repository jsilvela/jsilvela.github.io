<h2 id="two-headed-things">Two-headed things</h2>
<p>Polynomials are unexpectedly strange.
They&rsquo;re familiar from primary school, probably the first <em>functions</em> we study.
But start studying abstract algebra or
algebraic geometry, and they turn into two-headed beasts.</p>
<p>In abstract algebra you start to emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials.
You define addition of two polynomials much like you define component-wise
addition of vectors. Multiplication gives polynomials a <strong>ring</strong> structure.</p>
<p>The textbook definition of the polynomial ring $latex K[x]$ over a
field $latex K$ de-emphasizes that polynomials are functions.
You could use vector notation to make this even clearer.</p>
<p>$latex a x^2 + b x + c \equiv (a, b, c) \in K[x] $</p>
<p>Algebra books define the <strong>evaluation homomorphism</strong> to treat
function-ness separately. Given the polynomial ring
$latex K[x]$ and $latex\alpha \in K$, the application:</p>
<p>$latex ev_{\alpha}: K[x] \rightarrow K $</p>
<p>$latex ev_{\alpha}(f) = f(\alpha) $</p>
<p>is easily proven to be a ring homomorphism.</p>
<p>You could do without the functional part of polynomials a lot of the time. But
sometimes that part comes to the rescue in surprising ways.</p>
<h2 id="nullstellensatz">Nullstellensatz</h2>
<p>This famous theorem of Hilbert left me a bit confused initially.</p>
<p>Essentially, it says that the set of <strong>algebraic varieties</strong> in $latex \mathbb{C}^n$
is in 1-1 correspondence with the set of <strong>radical ideals</strong>
in $latex \mathbb{C}[x_1,..,x_n]$.</p>
<p>An <strong>ideal</strong> of a ring is a subset of the ring that is closed under additions,
and such that the product of an element in the ideal with <em>any</em> element in the
ring, is also in the ideal.</p>
<p>A <strong>radical ideal</strong> is an ideal where, if some power of an element belongs,
then the element belongs.</p>
<p>An example of a non-radical ideal is the ideal generated by $latex f(x) = x^2$,
aka $latex (x^2)$. $latex f(x) = x$ does not belong to the ideal, but
$latex f(x) = x^2$ does.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: <em>the</em> ideal of polynomials that are zero on an algebraic
variety $latex V$ is a radical ideal.<br>
This is almost trivial. Say $latex f \in K[x]$, and $latex f^k$ is zero
over $latex V$. Because the polynomial <em>function</em> takes values in a field, and
a field is an integral domain, we must have $latex f(x) = 0,  \forall x \in V$.</p>
<p>There you have it, the function-ness saves the day. Otherwise, proving that an
ideal is radical may be no picnic.</p>
<p>You noticed I said &ldquo;<em>the</em> ideal of polynomials that are&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
There is generally more than one ideal whose polynomials are zero on a variety,
but there is only one ideal that contains all the polynomials that are zero on the variety,
and it happens to be radical.</p>
<p>Nullstellensatz gives us
a 1-1 correspondence between the variety $latex V$ and <em>the</em> radical idea
of polynomials that are zero on $latex V$.</p>
<h3 id="an-exercise">An exercise</h3>
<p>This exercise from <em>An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry</em> by Karen E. Smith
et. al. took me a while to solve:</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.3.1 (abridged)</strong> <em>Check that the ideal $latex (xy, xz)$ is radical.</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an algebraic route to this, which seemed forbidding to me: to imagine
some $latex f^k$ in the ideal, and prove that $latex f$ must also be in the ideal.</p>
<p>But the Nullstellensatz opens up a different path: Prove that $latex (xy, xz)$
is <em>the</em> ideal of functions that are zero on the variety
defined by $latex (xy, xz)$.</p>
<p>This sounds silly to the point of tautology. One would expect that any ideal
$latex I$ should be <em>the</em> ideal for the variety it defines. Yet&hellip;</p>
<p>We can define a variety using a non-radical ideal. Think of the ideal $latex I$
generated
by $latex (x^2 - 1)^2$. Its associated variety is $latex V=\{1, -1\}$.
But there is a radical ideal, $latex I = (x^2 - 1)$, which is <em>the</em> ideal
associated with the variety $latex V$.</p>
<p>How do we prove that $latex (xy, xz)$ is <em>the</em> ideal? We need to prove that
any function that is zero on the variety must be in the ideal.
The variety is easily seen to be
$latex V=\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{C}^3, x=0 \text{ or } y=z=0\}$</p>
<p>Say a polynomial $latex g$ is zero on $latex V$. Since $latex x=0 \rightarrow g=0$,
we can deduce that it must be divisible by $latex x$. Indeed, by long division,</p>
<p>$latex g = q x + r(y, z)$, and if we let $latex x=0$, we see we must
have $latex r(y, z) = 0$.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s study the quotient $latex q$. Clearly, like $latex g$,
$latex q=0 \text{ if } y=z=0$</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to divide $latex q$ by $latex y$. If it is fully divisible
by $latex y$, say $latexq = q_0 y$, we&rsquo;re done,
because $latex g = x q_0y \rightarrow g \in (xy, xz)$.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume there&rsquo;s a remainder:</p>
<p>$latex q = q_1y + r_1(x, z)$</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s divide again, this time $latex r_1$ by $latex z$.</p>
<p>$latex q = q_1y + q_2z + r_2(x)$</p>
<p>Since $latex q = 0$ when $latex y=z=0$, we must have $latex r_2(x) = 0$.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>$latex q = q_1y + q_2z \rightarrow g = x q_1 y + x q_2z \rightarrow g \in (xy, xz)$</p>
<p>We conclude that $latex (xy, xz)$ is <em>the</em> ideal for $latex V$, so it&rsquo;s radical.</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The long division algorithm is algebraic, mostly</li>
<li>But we used the function values to annul remainders</li>
</ul>
<p>It still surprises me to switch back and forth on polynomials,
more so than with other objects of dual nature.</p>
