<p>I like <a href="http://xmonad.org/">Xmonad</a> much better than any other window manager (on any platform), but the default mod key is Alt, which interferes with Emacs and Conkeror.</p>
<p>Here is how to <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Frequently%5Fasked%5Fquestions#Rebinding%5Fthe%5Fmod%5Fkey%5F.28Alt%5Fconflicts%5Fwith%5Fother%5Fapps.3B%5FI%5Fwant%5Fthe%5F%5F%5F%5F%5Fkey.21.29">remap the mod key in Xmonad</a></p>
<p>Or, locally copied on Aug 09:</p>

Binding to the mod4 (often 'Win') key. Put this in yout xmonad.hs:</p>
<pre>
import XMonad
main = xmonad defaultConfig
    {
      modMask = mod4Mask
    }
</pre>
