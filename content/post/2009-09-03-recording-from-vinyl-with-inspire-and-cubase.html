<ol>
<li>Connect the Inspire to the computer and the phono pre-amp</li>
<li>Start the Inspire software and make sure channels 3-4 are unmuted and the volume is OK </li>
<li>Start Cubase, do File =&gt; New Project, and Project =&gt; Add Track =&gt; Audio</li>
<li>Go to Devices =&gt; Device Setup</li>
<li>In the VST Audio System, choose the Inspire and hit OK</li>
<li>Go to Devices =&gt; VST Connections</li>
<li>In the Input tab, choose channels 3 and 4 for input</li>
<li>In the Output tab, choose channels 1 and 2 for output (connect your headphones to the Inspire, not the computer)</li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to keep the Inspire connected at all times, even if youâ€™re exporting a pre-recorded track to  AIFF!<br />
With this you should be able to start recording.</p>
