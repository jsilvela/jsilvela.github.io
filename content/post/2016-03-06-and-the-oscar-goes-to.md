In order to prepare myself to write a program for clustering of numeric arrays,
I lived for two months in a numeric array.

I got to understand the difficulties numbers face, being bunched
into clusters, and how they try to maintain their individual
identities and their dignity.

Above all, my JavaScript code is an homage to them.
Thank you.
