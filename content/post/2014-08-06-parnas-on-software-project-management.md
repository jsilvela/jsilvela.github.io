From Software Fundamentals. Collected Papers by David L. Parnas p. 604

> One of Millsâ€™s most important lessons had to do with the difference between
> management and engineering. He did not try to tell us how to make unmanageable
> projects manageable. He showed us how to make projects manageable.
> He understood that only well-designed and well-documented projects could be
> managed properly; he taught us how to design products in ways that made
> management easier. Today, when so many papers discuss software engineering as if
> the problem was simply project management, I miss Harlan Mills.
