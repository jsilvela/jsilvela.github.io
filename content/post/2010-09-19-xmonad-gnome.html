<p>I’m positively impressed with Linux lately, as I learn more.<br />
By combining the tiling window manager Xmonad with the GNOME environment, I’ve found my favorite windowing system on any platform.</p>
<p>I used these <a href="http://markhansen.co.nz/xmonad-ubuntu-lucid">basic instructions</a>, but configured Xmonad to use the Window key (aka. Super key) as modifier instead of Alt, so that it doesn’t interfere with the Emacs keybindings. This is how it looks.<br />
</p>
<pre>
import XMonad
import XMonad.Config.Gnome
main = xmonad gnomeConfig
      {
        modMask = mod4Mask
      }
</pre>
