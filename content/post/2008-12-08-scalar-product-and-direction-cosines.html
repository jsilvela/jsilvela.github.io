<p>When I learned about the scalar product in high school, I was somewhat
surprised by how lucky its properties are.<br /> The treatment is usually this:
define $latex  x \cdot y = |x| |y| \cos \theta $, where $latex \theta $ is the
angle between $latex x $ and $latex y $. Then deduce that $latex x \cdot y $ is
linear on the left and right arguments. Then, deduce that $latex (x_1 \vec i +
x_2 \vec j + x_3 \vec k) \cdot (y_1 \vec i + y_2 \vec j + y_3 \vec k)  = x_1 y_1
+ x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 $</p>

<p>Now, define the direction cosines of a vector $latex x $ as the cosines of
the angles the vector forms with the basis vectors. By definition: $latex x =
|x| (\cos \phi_1, \cos \phi_2, \cos \phi_3) $.<br /> If we define $latex \theta
$ as the angle between $latex x $ and $latex y $, $latex \alpha_i $ as the
angles between $latex x $ and the axis, and $latex \beta_i $ as the angles
between $latex y $ and the axis, we have: $latex \cos \theta = \sum_i \cos
\alpha_i \cos \beta_i $.</p>

<p>This last formula mystified me. The deduction was so purely algebraic that I
found it unsatisfactory. I wanted to see the geometric meaning.</p>

<p>A more geometric deduction follows: $latex (\cos \alpha_1, \cos \alpha_2,
\cos \alpha_3) $ is a point $latex a $ on the unit sphere. If we take another
point $latex b $ on the unit sphere, the subtend an angle $latex \theta $:<br />

<p>On the unit sphere, we can find the angle $latex \theta $ subtended by $latex
a $ and $latex b $, by calculating the distance $latex l $ between them:<br />

<p>As you can see in the picture, $latex l = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} $.
Therefore:
$$ 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{(\sum (\cos \alpha_i - \cos \beta_i)^2}$$

By basic trigonometry:
$$ \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}}$$

Putting the above two together:
$$ 4 \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2} = \sum
(\cos \alpha_i - \cos \beta_i)^2  = \sum (\cos^2 \alpha_i - 2 \cos \alpha_i \cos
\beta_i + \cos^2 \beta_i)$$

Since $latex a$ and $latex b$ are both on the
unit sphere:
$$ 4 \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2} = 2 - \sum 2 \cos \alpha_i \cos \beta_i $$,
and
$$ \cos \theta = \sum \cos \alpha_i \cos \beta_i$$

<p>In this deduction of $latex \cos \theta $, we didnâ€™t assume any knowledge of
the scalar product. In fact, we could have used it as a basis for the definition
of the scalar product.</p>
