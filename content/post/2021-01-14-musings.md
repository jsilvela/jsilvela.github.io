## The madness of font rendering in macOS

*macOS* rendering is getting worse and worse for non-Retina screens.

The iPad renders crisp text, so can't comment on *iOS/iPadOS*, but on my
respectable 2560x1440 monitor, using *macOS*, text seemed somewhat fuzzy. To the
point where I was thinking I'd have to buy a 4K monitor. On Windows and Linux,
the same monitor rendered text like a champ, so I decided the problem was not
the screen.

Apple have been gradually dropping the smoothing configuration
options they used to offer, and now they
offer none. It seems they expect everyone to have 4K screens.

You can find some command-line hacks to tweak
the font smoothing to work better for low-mid resolutions,
but hacks like that are likely to disappear silently, sooner rather
than later.

There is good material in the web about the various forms of text anti-aliasing,
and their use in different operating systems.
I recommend [The Ails of Typographic Anti-Aliasing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/)

The article mentions that the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
browser handles rendering on its own, in an effort to render text sharper.

For email, [Postbox](https://www.postbox-inc.com/) also does a decent job.

Aside from hunting for programs that subvert macOS, you might want to use
light fonts when you have a choice. Which brings me to:

## Monospaced fonts I recommend

Any font choice is personal, of course, but some font characteristics affect
how well it renders on screen.

**Thickness.** Some fonts are thicker/darker, some thinner/lighter.
For example, *Consolas* is on the
thick side, *IBM Plex Mono* is on the lighter side. Aside from your personal
taste, thinner fonts may render better in software like Safari or, generally,
*macOS*, whereas Windows tends to thin fonts, so light fonts may appear
washed out. Not all programs in the same computer render text the same.

**Spacing and rhythm.** The fixed width corset forces the strokes to be thin and
spindly. With thicker strokes, the letter `m` could scarcely be made to fit
the same width as the letter `i`. \
There's an inherent waste of space, and some font designs combat this by stretching
the letterforms to the max, leaving little space between letters, while others
embrace the irregular spacing. \
Aside from taste, font rendering may alter the spacing of letterforms. On some
programs or systems, a particular font may become "crowded" or spacy.

Given the variety of screens, resolutions, operating systems, and rendering
tweaks, it's good that we have several good fonts to choose from.

My short list of great fonts:

* [*Fira Mono*](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FiraMono/):
  on the moderate-light side. This font renders amazingly well, and
  offers detail to catch the eye, while not being gimmicky. Lacks italics.
* [*Consolas*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/consolas):
  on the darker side. A classic for good reason. But, renders a bit
  fuzzy on *macOS*; it was designed with Windows's *ClearType* in mind.
* [*Hack*](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/):
  between Fira and Consolas, in terms of thickness. Another descendant of the venerable
  [*Bitstream Vera*](https://www.gnome.org/fonts/) lineage, along with *DejaVu*
  and *Menlo*.
* [*Latin Modern Mono*](https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/latinmodernmono/):
  light. Serif, which is unusual for a fixed-width font. Renders amazingly well on macOS.
* [*Lexia Mono*](https://www.daltonmaag.com/library/lexia-mono):
  dark. Serif, like *Latin Modern*. What *Courier* wishes it could be.

## Configuration is for suckers

I used to keep my configuration files for Emacs, and for various Linux window
managers, and carried them with me, like a turtle.
That was foolish. I have mended my ways.

Today, on the various text editors I use, I just configure font and size, and a few
other prominent adjustments.
On Linux I use desktop environments, and barely configure them.

Linux is still a bit behind on support for HiDPI and switching between resolutions.
Some programs respect GNOME's settings, some don't.
Still, how far we've come.

I have come to think that a tell-tale sign of poor design is the over-abundance
of configuration options.

## The 16px standard for web, and, Bless the iPad

As a gentleman website-owner, I'm aware of the difficulty designing web pages. You
cannot know where your pages are going to be read. Font size, in particular, is maddening:
you might think that setting your font size in terms of percentages or *ems* will
ensure good rendering in most conditions, but I don't recommend it.

For some strange reason, 16px has become the baseline of font sizes on the web. Phones,
tablets, laptops: they all try to ensure 16px size is readable on their screens.
Desktop computers, what with the variety of screen sizes, resolutions,
scaling settings, are chaos.

But today, most good web designers will try to make sure their site renders well
on iPads.

iPads have an interesting advantage. Since we hold them at book distance, we get
a better idea of the size of text on them.

And, here's the thing, 16px is small. Like 9pt, text in 16px is readable, but
not as comfortably readable as text set in 10pt or 11pt.

For comfortable reading on web, choose 18-22px.

The iPad may help you realize that you are, likely, reading text on your
computer screens at very small sizes.
