For many years now, I’ve struggled with the amount of information that I would
like to absorb. I’m trying out sometihg new: to keep track of things I see
or read or think about, in the form of posts.

I started out with my [personal blog](http://silvela.org/jaime/lost/post/2018-06-24-keeping-track/),
and so far, I like the idea.

So, there will be posts now and then where I just keep track of stuff.
