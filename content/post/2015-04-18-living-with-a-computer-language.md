I’m not a big fan of David Lean’s movie “Doctor Zhivago”, but it contains a line I love:
“He approved of us, but for reasons which were subtle, like his verse.”

The older I get, the more I become averse to the snap judgements that seem to
pervade the software industry. I particularly hate the genre of the shootout
article. It’s bad enough for web browser comparisons, but it’s terrible for
everything else. When applied to languages, this philosophy gives rise to
articles showing a strong preference for, say, Python over Ruby, on the grounds
that a little toy project is 3 lines shorter and 5% faster in Python.

In some cases, a language is clearly junk, but more often than not, it is unwise
to make a language choice based on performance for your pet toy program. I'd go
as far as saying that it takes months to get what a language is about. When you
reach that point, it is likely that your complaints will be subtle, and poorly
suited to gladiatorial review.

These days I've been using and liking the Go language. I've written a few
programs in it, and I'm going to use it for my project at work. I look at this
language with hope. I happen to think that the Java + XML + Patterns + TDD
fundamentalism that has been ruling the software industry is a bleak place to
be, and plain boring. Go is pithy and idiosyncratic, and still a
serious, typed, compiled language. I ignore the language purists complaining
about the lack of generics, or this or that pet peeve. I've been living with Go,
and I'm keeping it.
