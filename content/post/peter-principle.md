title = "The Peter principle, for software"

+++

The famous [Peter
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) lives large
for computer programming abstractions.

It can be in a positive way: operations that are well understood, and
routine, are abstracted into a higher level that one must actually
think about.

But very often it's in a pathological way: raising abstraction for the
purpose of raising abstraction, until you end up with a pile of
abstract spaghetti code, which is even harder to understand than
regular spaghetti code.

I always try to keep my abstractions grounded enough. I know no
recipes, other than vigilance, and correcting missteps.
